# Fix Console Output Buffering Issues

## Issue Description
The Rich library currently experiences buffering issues in certain environments, particularly affecting:
1. Real-time progress updates
2. Animated spinners
3. Table updates
4. Basic text output

These issues manifest as:
- Chunked output instead of smooth character-by-character display
- Jumpy progress bars instead of smooth increments
- Flickering animations
- Delayed table updates

## Visual Examples

### Before Fix:
```
# Basic Text Buffering
This text might be buffered:.....
(All dots appear at once)

# Progress Bar
⠋ Processing... [====================] 100%
(Jumps directly to 100%)

# Spinner
Loading: ⠋⠙⠹⠸⠼⠴⠦⠧⠇⠏
(All characters appear at once)
```

### After Fix:
```
# Basic Text Buffering
This text will appear smoothly:.
This text will appear smoothly:..
This text will appear smoothly:...
(Smooth character-by-character display)

# Progress Bar
⠋ Processing... [=] 5%
⠙ Processing... [==] 10%
⠹ Processing... [===] 15%
(Smooth progress updates)

# Spinner
Loading: ⠋
Loading: ⠙
Loading: ⠹
(Smooth animation)
```

## Implementation Details

1. Added two new methods to the Console class:
   - `print_buffered()`: For controlled buffering of basic text output
   - `print_progress()`: Specifically for progress updates and animations

2. Key features:
   - Force flush after each print operation
   - Proper handling of carriage returns for progress updates
   - Consistent behavior across different terminal types
   - Windows-specific optimizations

## Testing

1. Added comprehensive test file `test_console_buffering_fix.py` with examples for:
   - Basic text buffering
   - Progress updates
   - Spinner animations
   - Table updates

2. Test coverage:
   - Windows Command Prompt
   - PowerShell
   - Unix-like terminals
   - CI/CD environments

## Usage Examples

```python
from rich.console import Console

console = Console()

# Basic buffered output
console.print_buffered("Loading:", end="")
for i in range(5):
    console.print_buffered(".", end="")
    time.sleep(0.5)

# Progress updates
console.print_progress("Processing...", end="\r")
for i in range(100):
    console.print_progress(f"Progress: {i}%", end="\r")
    time.sleep(0.1)

# Spinner animation
spinner = "⠋⠙⠹⠸⠼⠴⠦⠧⠇⠏"
for char in spinner:
    console.print_progress(f"Loading: {char}", end="\r")
    time.sleep(0.1)
```

## Impact

This fix improves:
1. User experience with smoother animations
2. Reliability of progress indicators
3. Consistency across different platforms
4. Real-time feedback in long-running operations

## Additional Notes

- The fix maintains backward compatibility
- No breaking changes to existing APIs
- Minimal performance impact
- Works with all Rich features (tables, progress bars, etc.)

## Testing Instructions

1. Run the test file:
```bash
python tests/test_console_buffering_fix.py
```

2. Verify smooth output in:
   - Windows Command Prompt
   - PowerShell
   - Unix-like terminals
   - CI/CD environments
