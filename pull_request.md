# Console Output Buffering Improvements

## Issue
The Rich library's console output buffering can cause issues with real-time updates, affecting:
- Progress bars and spinners
- Table updates
- Basic text output
- Animated content

## Solution
Added new buffering methods to the Console class to provide better control over output buffering:

1. `print_buffered()`: Print with controlled buffering
   - Custom buffer size support
   - Forced flushing option
   - Maintains original buffer size

2. `print_progress()`: Specialized method for progress updates
   - Uses carriage return by default
   - Optimized for real-time updates
   - Built on top of print_buffered

3. `buffered_output()`: Context manager for buffered output
   - Temporary buffer size modification
   - Automatic cleanup
   - Thread-safe

4. `measure_performance()`: Performance measurement tool
   - Compares buffered vs unbuffered output
   - Configurable iteration count
   - Returns timing metrics

## Visual Examples

### Before:
```
Loading.... Done!  # Appears all at once
Progress: 100%     # Jumps to final value
⠋⠙⠹⠸⠼⠴⠦⠧⠇⠏  # Spinner appears in chunks
```

### After:
```
Loading. . . . . Done!  # Smooth character output
Progress: 0% -> 100%    # Smooth progress updates
⠋⠙⠹⠸⠼⠴⠦⠧⠇⠏  # Fluid spinner animation
```

## Implementation Details

### Buffer Management
- Default buffer size: 8192 bytes
- Automatic buffer size restoration
- Thread-safe operations
- Windows compatibility

### Performance Optimizations
- Minimal overhead for buffered operations
- Efficient buffer size management
- Smart flushing strategy

### Usage Examples

```python
# Basic buffered output
console.print_buffered("Loading", end="")
for _ in range(5):
    time.sleep(0.2)
    console.print_buffered(".", end="", flush=True)

# Progress updates
for i in range(101):
    console.print_progress(f"Progress: {i}%", end="")
    time.sleep(0.02)

# Context manager
with console.buffered_output(buffer_size=1024):
    for i in range(5):
        console.print_buffered(f"Line {i+1}")
```

## Testing
Added comprehensive test file `test_console_buffering_improvements.py` that demonstrates:
1. Basic buffered output
2. Progress updates
3. Spinner animations
4. Table updates
5. Context manager usage
6. Performance measurements

## Impact
- Improved user experience with smoother output
- Better real-time update handling
- More reliable progress indicators
- Consistent behavior across platforms
- Minimal performance overhead
