Please note that Rich isn't accepting any new features at this point.

If a feature can be implemented without modifying the core library, then
they should be released as a third-party module. I can accept updates to the
core library that make it easier to extend (think hooks).

Bugfixes are always welcome of course.

Sometimes it is not clear what is a feature and what is a bug fix.
If there is any doubt, please open a discussion first.
