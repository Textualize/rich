### Changed

- Optimized progress.track for very quick iterations
- Force default size of 80x25 if get_terminal_size reports size of 0,0

## [4.0.0] - 2020-07-23

Major version bump for a breaking change to `Text.stylize signature`, which corrects a minor but irritating API wart. The style now comes first and the `start` and `end` offsets default to the entire text. This allows for `text.stylize_all(style)` to be replaced with `text.stylize(style)`. The `start` and `end` offsets now support negative indexing, so `text.stylize("bold", -1)` makes the last character bold.
