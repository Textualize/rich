Rich will highlight certain patterns in your output such as numbers, strings, and other objects like IP addresses.

Occasionally this may also highlight parts of your output you didn't intend. See the [docs on highlighting](https://rich.readthedocs.io/en/latest/highlighting.html) for how to disable highlighting.
